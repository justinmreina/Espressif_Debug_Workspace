@section    Espressif-IDE Project Explorer

    @loc  out/espressif-ide/Project_Explorer_issues.png

    - espressif-ide 'Project Explorer' error markings


@section    VS Code Strange Bug

    @loc  out/vs_code/hello_world_issue_2.png

    - what is the 'Internal Compiler Error' for 'rgb_panel_draw_bitmap'? I get this 
      periodically and have no idea why. And in this case now, cleaning the project 
      and removing build\ quickly resolves the problem providing a clean build


@section    Project Include Paths

    @loc  out/ (else)

    - espressif-ide include warnings

    - vs code include warnings
